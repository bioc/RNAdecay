\title{sum of the squared errors for null models}
\usage{
sse_null_decaying_decay(a, b, m, t)

sse_null_const_decay(a, m, t)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{alpha value}

\item{b}{beta value}

\item{m}{mRNA abundance values}

\item{t}{time points of \code{m}}
}
\value{
Returns the sum of the squared errors
}
\description{
For a model that uses a constant decay rate or a decaying decay rate, calculates the sum of the squared errors (differences between the supplied data points and the modeled values based on alpha and/or beta values). For these models all treatments are assumed to have the same \code{a} (alpha) and/or \code{b} (beta).
